# Template for building Android Games

This is the starting code template for building a 2D game in Android.

Most games are built using a framework (Unity, SpriteKit, [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)) - and we will too. But for the first part of the course, we will build our own custom game engine to learn how game mechanics work.

## How to use the template

1. Start a new Android project
2. Copy and paste the code above into your MainActivity.java file
3. Don't forget to update the *package names* to match your project.

The package name shown above is: `com.example.parrot.myapplication`
You will need to change this to match your package name.

## Expected Output

If you run the program, you will get a blank screen. Like this:
